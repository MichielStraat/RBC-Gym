# Rayleigh-BÃ¨nard Convection Simulation

## Setup
We use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage python dependencies. Install virtual environment via:
```bash
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

The simulation is based on Julia. Please install according to their [docs](https://julialang.org/install/) or via their standalone installer:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh
```

## Get started
### Run plain environment
Small example to run a 2D Rayleigh-Benard Convection simulation wrapped in a gym environment:
```bash
python example/run.py
```
### Run in parallel utilizing vectorized envs
```bash
python example/run_vectorized.py
```
### Run with wrappers
```bash
python example/run_wrappers.py
```

## Gym environment
```python
env = gym.make(
        "rbc_gym/RayleighBenardConvection2D-v0",
        render_mode="human",
    )
```

## Time efficiency
Time comparison vs a shenfun based simulation. Averaged over 1000 iterations on an apple sillicone based system.
